# Archive Directory

This directory contains archived files from the development process. These files are kept for historical reference but are not part of the active codebase.

## Directory Structure

### `experimental_code/`
Contains experimental and deprecated Python scripts:
- Multiple versions of `consistent_training_implementation.py` with various modifications
- Truncated and reinforced versions of training implementations
- Different experimental approaches and parameter variations

**Note**: These files represent iterative development and experimentation. The current active implementation is in the root directory.

### `deprecated_results/`
Contains older experimental results and analysis:
- Historical result folders from different experimental phases
- Previous visualization outputs
- Old parameter studies and comparisons
- Jupyter notebooks from exploratory analysis

### `duplicate_files/`
Contains duplicate image files that were identified during cleanup:
- Multiple versions of the same visualization with slight variations
- Redundant comparison plots
- Duplicate experimental outputs

## Purpose

This archive serves to:
- Preserve the development history and experimental iterations
- Maintain access to previous experimental results for reference
- Keep track of different approaches that were explored
- Provide backup of important experimental data

## Usage

These files are primarily for reference purposes. For current experiments and analysis, use the active codebase in the root directory and the organized results in the `../results/` directory.

If you need to reference historical experiments or understand the evolution of the project, this archive provides a complete record of the development process.
